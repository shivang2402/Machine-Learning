### Purpose of this Repository

This repository contains my collection of machine learning assignments and projects, documenting my hands-on learning journey.

Each notebook focuses on practical implementation of ML techniques, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

The work reflects my effort to understand how theoretical machine learning concepts translate into real-world problem solving.

I use these experiments to compare algorithms, tune performance, and strengthen my foundation in model development.

This repository also serves as a personal reference for future research, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration.
